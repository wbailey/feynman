		<h1>Controller Overview</h1>
		One major part of the framework is the Controller class.  This is the class that performs
		setup and actually runs the simulation.  It has a lot of
		responsibility but for this discussion we will focus on the parts that are important to
		the sample application.  A more detailed discussion of the Controller can be found in the
		<a href="framework.html">Framework Overview</a>.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The first responsibility of the Controller is to load the <em>Simulation.properties</em> 
		file as you see from the command line when you ran the sample application.  This
		file tells the Controller what you want it to do for the simulation.  Details of this file
		will be discussed later when you have a more thorough understanding of what needs to be
		done in order to build an application that uses the Framework.
		<br/><br/>
		For now it is enough to understand this file tells the Controller the following pieces of
		information:
		<ul>
			<li>The type of Physical System that is being used.</li>
			<li>What coordinate system the simulation is being performed in.</li>
			<li>What type of Physical Object is being studied and how many of them will be
			    used in the simulation</li>
			<li>What classes should be used to execute the simulation that you have developed.</li>
			<li>Should the simulation perform measurements?  If so how often should a measurement
				be taken?  Where will the data for a measurement be stored?</li>
			<li>Should the Controller produce a final report that you have developed?</li>
		</ul>
		This may seem like a lot information and it is, but the Framework is extremely 
		flexible and highly configurable, and this file is the messenger to the Controller all the
		information that is needed to run your simulation.
		<br/><br/>
		After the Controller loads this information, it starts to process it and see if it can do
		what you instructed it to do.  It tries to create, in order, the following for you:
		<ol>
			<li>The actual Simulation.</li>
			<li>A Physical System that is a collection of Physical Objects</li>
			<li>The Physical Objects needed by the Physical System.</li>
			<li>The Physical Algorithm needed to perform the Simulation.</li>
			<li>The Physical Measurement to be performed.</li>
			<li>A Data Source to store Physical Measurement information.</li>
			<li>If specified, a Final Report</li>
		</ol>
		This again may seem like a lot to create and be responsible for, but the 
		Framework has been developed so that you do not have to develop these mechanisms yourself to
		perform these tasks.
		<br/><br/>
		If the Controller can create all of the items listed above, it then begins executing
		the Simulation.  At any point if it can create any of the items it will produce a
		detailed error message alerting the user what caused the error.  If possible it will
		try and provide a hint as to how the error can be avoided, but this may not be a feature
		of early releases of the Framework.
		<br/><br/>
		The Controller executes the Simulation by performing the following steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Perform an iteration using the Physical Algorithm.</li>
			<li>If necessary, perform a Physical Measurement</li>
			<li>If necessary, store the Physical Measure to the Data Source</li>
			<li>Check if the Simulation should still be executing</li>
			<li>If the Simulation is running, then repeat from Step 1.</li>
			<li>If the Simulation has completed, then produce a Final Report if 
				necessary and write any remaining data to the Data Source.</li>
		</ol>
		The whole process of the Controller can be understood be understood in the
		<a href="framework.html">next</a> section. A thorough understanding can be obtained by examining the
		<a href="#" onClick="DynaWin('Controller.java.html', '400', '550', '0', '0')";>source code</a>.
		Study the code and when you believe you have a general understanding of it, then you will definitely
		be ready to go to the <a href="framework.html">Framework Overview</a> section which will explain
		in detail the guts of the Framework and how it is put together.
