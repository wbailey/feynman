		<h1>The Sample Application</h1>
		Running the sample application requires that you at least have Sun's Java&trade; Java Runtime 
		Environment (JRE) version 1.3 or later installed.  If your machine does not have at least the JRE
		on it, then	download it from Sun's Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/download">download page</a>. 
		If you want to build applications using the framework, then download the latest Java 2 Software
		Development (SDK) Standard Edition.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		To run the sample application first switch into the sample_app directory as shown
<pre>
wbailey:/tmp> cd sample_app/
</pre>
		After you are there make sure that the <b>feynman.jar</b> file is present and if it is, then
		issue the following command:
<pre>
wbailey:/tmp/sample_app> java -jar feynman.jar config/Simulation.properties 
</pre>
		If Java is installed correctly on your machine, then everything should run without error and 
		produce the following output exactly as it appears below:
<pre>
Using properties file: config/Simulation.properties
Creating the physical system...created
Configuring system using &lt;Setup&gt;...configured
Configuring Algorithm using &lt;SimpleGravity&gt;...configured
Configuring Physical Measurement using &lt;Measurement&gt;...configured
Configuring the Persistent Data Source using &lt;file&gt;...complete
Configuring the FinalReport using &lt;Report&gt;...complete
Running simulation...complete

---------- Simulation Report -----------
max height:         5.05 m
impact velocity:   -9.99 m/s
total flight time:  2.04 s

		Congradulations!  Dr. Feynman would be proud of you because you just numerically simulated
		a ball being launched up in the air under Newton's Law of Gravity.  You should also
		notice that the sample application produced a data file that is in Comma Seperated Value
		(CSV) format as shown below:
<pre>
wbailey:/tmp/sample_app> dir
build.xml    classes/     config/      <b>data.csv</b>     feynman.jar  lib/         src/
</pre>
		The file has all of the measurement data that was taken during the simulation.  As you will learn
		later, when you are developing an application you have the ability to specify what measurements will be
		taken and how often they will be performed during the simulation.  The sample application has
		specified to record the following data that appears in the following columns:
		<ol>
			<li><em>Time</em> - The elapsed time when the mearsurement was taken.</li>
			<li><em>Height</em> - The y position of the ball.</li>
			<li><em>Kinetic Energy</em></li>
			<li><em>Potential Energy</em></li>
			<li><em>Total Energy</em></li>
		</ol>
		The first ten lines of the <b>data.csv</b> file are listed below:
<pre>
wbailey:/tmp/sample_app> head data.csv

		For further analysis the data could be imported into a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel&trade; or
		another equivalent free graphing utility like <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a> available
		for free under the GNU General Public License (GPL) written by the
		<a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.  If you have never used gnuplot, then
		copy the following into your favorite editor and save as <b>using.gnu</b>:
<pre>
set title "Energy Plot"
set key below box
set xrange [0:2.1]
set yrange [0:55]
set xlabel 'Time (Sec)'
set ylabel 'Energy (Joule)'
plot 'data.csv' using 1:3 title "Kinetic" with lines,\
     'data.csv' using 1:4 title "Potential" with lines;
</pre>
		After you save the file, start gnuplot from the shell command prompt and type the
		following:
<pre>
wbailey:/tmp/sample_app> gnuplot

Terminal type set to 'pict'
gnuplot> cd '/tmp/sample_app'
gnuplot> load 'using.gnu'
gnuplot>
</pre>
		The first command tells gnuplot to change the specified directory where the <b>data.csv</b> and
		<b>using.gnu</b> files are located.  The next step tells it to load the file that has all of the
		plotting commnds in it.  Note the the directory and filename are surrounded by <em>single</em> 
		quotes.  Double quotes should work as well.  Lack of quotes will produce an error.  If everything
		is done correctly, the you should see the following plot appear as shown below:
